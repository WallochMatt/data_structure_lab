Practicing with different data structures

Dictionary, Set and Tuple
Given the following three scenarios, choose the best data structure (between a dictionary, set, or tuple) to efficiently store
the data. Each scenario ties directly to one data structure. Each data structure will be used only once. You will need to
determine which data structure is best for which scenario, and then implement the data structure in Python.

-Store the months of the year as strings. Determine the month in the data structure in which National Pi Day exists and print that 
month to the console. 

-Store five fruits or vegetables.
Add two of your favorite fruits and two of your favorite vegetables to the collection.
Iterate over the collection and print each one to the console.
 
-Store information about a user profile. Use literal string interpolation to print the userâ€™s profile information to the console. 
The profile should consist of the following information:
	First Name
	Last Name
	Email Address
	Phone Number

List of Dictionaries
Use a list to store the dictionary of your immediate family members, with each index of the list storing
its own dictionary. Dictionary should contain the following keys:
	First name
	Last name
	Relation to you

Once you have stored the List of Dictionary items, write a function/method that will iterate over the List 
and print off the First Name and Relation of each person in the List.
